![Me and Morgan sparring](/me-morgan.jpg)

* I felt much better at this practice than I did last week.
* **Today's technique**: sweep from deep half.
* I've been focusing primarily on defense for the past couple of months and
until recently haven't even thought to _try_ staying on my feet and passing
anyone's guard. Today I managed to do a leg rope pass, and an ankle isolation
pressure pass so was very happy with myself.
* Even though I'm not focusing on it, my defense at this practice was as good as
usual. In particular I've defended probably fifty or sixty live sparring armbars
at this stage, so I feel pretty confident that if there's a chance to escape
from an armbar, I'll be able to exploit it.
* Sensei has me working on speed/strength, so in uchokomi I'm just drilling
triangles, armbars, and kimuras from closed guard at high speed, three sets of
thirty reps each. So that's ninety armbars, ninety triangles, and ninety kimuras
at each practice. This doesn't leave much time for practicing other techniques,
but I'm not one to argue with Sensei.
* I did manage to squeeze in practicing a de la Riva back-take, which I'm
feeling pretty confident about (from the left only). Now that I have a couple of
options from sitting guard I feel comfortable in that position and want to
develop it. But I'm focusing primarily on offense, in particular
standing/kneeling guard passes, so will put that on hold for the time being.
* During sparring I managed to sink an ezekiel. I got mount, tried to push the
guys arm up to aim for an arm triangle, but he saw it coming and wouldn't let go
of his dougi. So I gave up on the triangle, and seeing his neck open piled on
pressure with my shoulder from the other side, then set up the ezekiel and
pulled it in. This was by far the smoothest ezekiel I've ever landed in live
sparring, and I think it's because I threatened the arm triangle first.
